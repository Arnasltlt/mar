<p>What I like most about my work is having the freedom to create. What I mean by that is not that I can create anything I want, but that I have the privilege to take the time, look at my surroundings & the material available and create something useful.</p>

<p>This post is to show what the materials I've found in basements, garages and scrap material of my own work allowed me to create.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">The scrap material to a cube</h2>

<p>I've been working on custom projects for years and during that time I've accumulated skills, knowledge and a lot of scrap material.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the nature of these projects is that the look usually drives most of the material choices, which puts the material out of the spotlight.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Cube</h2>

<p>Seemingly the most obvious application for such scrap wood is to play a little bit of Tetris on this plywood base.</p>

<p>Now, add a little bit of love:</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Old into new</h2>

<p>Making sure the leftover material is used is very satisfying, but nothing adds so much more to a piece of furniture than material with a history.</p>

<p>You won't find the exact same looking frames anymore - they all have been scared by time in their own different way, but that just makes them even more special.</p>

<p>I had a chance to get my hands on some of these windows that were removed during a restoration of an old museum in my hometown and I immediately had an idea on how to recycle them.</p>

<p>Since the windows came in pairs, I made these twin cabinets. Sadly, the original glass was damaged during the removal and had to be replaced with a new one.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Naturally gray coffee table</h2>


<p> This is another example of recycling old material into furniture and the history that it adds to it. Here, I've reclaimed old wood that has naturally aged into this light gray color.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Recycled Oak table</h2>


<p> Now for this one, I was looking closer to home. After the reconstruction at our old family summer house, we had a bunch of old wood left over.</p>

<p>I found some wooden floor and some door frames that were still usable.</p>

<p>The floor went into a desktop:</p>

<p> And the doorframes into the rest of the construction </p>

<p>Bellow is what came out of it. Somehow, the wood wasn't enough so I added a leather strip through the middle of the table to finish it off.</p>

<p>Starting with these pieces of furniture, I've founded "Mar-Furniture" - a company which will always be inspired by the locally available material.</p>
